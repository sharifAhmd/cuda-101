- Will continue with PMPP books and the examples.

## Day-3
- Going through the Chapter-2 of PMPP book. 
- Worked on vector multiplications code based on the learning.
- Will continue with PMPP books and the examples.

## Day-4
- Going through the Chapter-3 of PMPP book on parallel execution. 
- Implemented RGB-GRAY-RGB code based on the learning.
- Will continue with PMPP books and the examples.

## Day-5

- Will continue with PMPP books and the examples.

## Day-6
- Completed Chapter-4 of PMPP book on GPU memory. 
- Implemented vector addition code based on shared memory concepts.
- Will continue with PMPP books and the examples.

## Day-7
- Going through Chapter-5 of PMPP book on Performance considerations. 
- Implemented parallel reduction based on learning.
- Will continue with PMPP books and the examples.

## Day-8
- Done with Chapter-5 of PMPP book on Performance considerations.
